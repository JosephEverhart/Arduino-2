# Arduino

This is my personal library which I began to write when I was learning Arduino programming (which is mainly C++ programming based on Arduino libraries).

Yet, it only contains the `Button` library which handle buttons connected to Arduino platforms.

## Important remark

Please note that I'm a beginner at C/C++ programming, thereby, my codes are not fully optimized nor efficient for a microcontroller (you'll see a lot of horrible `unsigned long` declarations), this will hopefully change in future, anyway feel free to modify my code in a microcontroller-friendly fashion.
